Q: Mrs. Hayes, you were in the neighborhood at the time of the incident?

A: Yes, that's right. I was at the corner store buying groceries around 9:00 PM.

Q: And you saw something?

A: Yes! I saw the suspect - the person you're looking for. It was definitely them. They were at the corner store on Main Street and Oak Avenue at 9:00 PM. I remember the time because I checked my phone to see how late the store was open.

Q: You're certain about the time?

A: Absolutely. It was 9:00 PM. I know because that's when the store gets busy before they close at 10.

Q: And you're absolutely certain it was the person in question?

A: Yes. I've known them for years. It was definitely them.
